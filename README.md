# Raspberry-Pi Driverless Car
In the modern day many people approach the idea of self-driving vehicles with 
a feeling of suspicion. Many people are apprehensive about sharing the roads 
with fully autonomous vehicles. In order to move forward into a safer driving 
environment, the approval of the general public is necessary. We be using a 
Raspberry-Pi with a camera attached to a remote-controlled car to exhibit that 
autonomous vehicles can share the road with human drivers and are in fact 
dependable. We can demonstrate that an autonomous car is safer than a human 
driver.
