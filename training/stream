This is the line to get the pi camera to stream video to another computer over
http, port 8160. Run this command on the Pi, then on the other computer, open vlc, go to media->open network
stream, and enter http://<pi's ip address>:8160

raspivid -o video.h264 - -t 0 -hf -w 800 -h 400 -fps 24 |cvlc -vvv stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ts,dst=:8160}' :demux=h264
